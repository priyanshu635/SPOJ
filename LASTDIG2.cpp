/*
Pappu was doing the work of his math class about three days but he is tired of make operations a lot and he should deliver his task tomorrow. His mathâ€™s teacher gives two numbers a and b. The problem consist in find the last digit of the potency of base a and index b. Help Pappu with his problem. You are given two integer numbers: the base a (number of digits d, such that 1<=d<=1000) and the index b (0 <= b <= 922*10^15). You
have to find the last digit of a^b.

                                                         Input
The first line of input contains an integer t, the number of test cases (t <= 30). t test cases follow. For
each test case will appear a and b separated by space.

                                                         Output
For each test case output an integer per line representing the result.

Example
Input:
3
3 10
6 2
150 53
Output:
9
6
0
